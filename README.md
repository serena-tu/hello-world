Lab - Git (Hello World), my first repository
Hi, I'm Serena! I'm currently a sophomore at Mason High School. In my free time, I like to watch tv, swim, and hang out with my friends. In the future, I want to major in computer science and I'm looking forward to learning more about web game development in this class!
